Q3. How do you define a function?

Q4. What is a function declaration?
    A function declaration defines a function with the specified parameters and code block. The function can be called before it is defined due to hoisting.


Q5. What is a function expression?
    A function expression defines a function inside an expression. The function can be anonymous and is not hoisted, so it cannot be called before it is defined.


Q6. What are arrow functions?
    Arrow functions provide a shorter syntax for writing functions. They do not have their own this context and are not hoisted.
